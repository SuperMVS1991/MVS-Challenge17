# Regex Tutorial Starter Code:

In this tutorial, I learned about regular expressions (regex) and how to use them effectively in your projects. As a beginner, I started to understand regex and how it can greatly enhance my ability to work with text patterns.

Summary:

The regex featured in this tutorial is /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/. This regex is commonly used to validate and extract hex color codes in HTML or CSS format, including both full six-character codes (#rrggbb) and three-character shorthand codes (#rgb).

Summary of the Featured Regex:

The regex /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ is used to match hex color codes in HTML or CSS format. It validates both full six-character codes (#rrggbb) and three-character shorthand codes (#rgb), with or without the leading # symbol.

Components of the Regex:
Anchors:

The ^ and $ anchors match the beginning and end of the string, respectively.

Quantifiers:

Quantifiers like {6} and {3} control the repetition of characters, ensuring valid hex color codes.

Character Classes:

Character classes [a-f0-9] and [0-9] match hexadecimal digits and digits, respectively.

Grouping and Capturing:

Parentheses (...) define groups for capturing and processing matched content.

Back-references:

Back-references \1, \2, etc., refer back to previously captured groups within the regex.

Boundaries:

The \b and \B boundaries match word boundaries or non-word boundaries, respectively.
Look-ahead and Look-behind and Look-ahead ('(?=...)') and look-behind ('(?<=...)') assertions check conditions without including them in the match.
